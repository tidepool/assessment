  # The raw results are expected in the form of:

  #   {
  #     :trait1 => "Sociable",

  #     :size => 3,
  #     :distance_rank => 2,
  #     :overlap => 0.34
  #   },
  #   ...
  # ]
  # Algorithm:
  # 1. Calculate the z-scores for each of size, distance and overlap
  # 2. Each name_pair (trait1/trait2) maps to an attribute of the assessment type (E.g. Openness for Big5)
  # 3. Multiply the z-scores by corresponding weights
  # 4. Add the weighted z-scores per attribute of assessment type.
  # 5. Average the weighted z-scores
  # The output is in the form of:
  # {
  #   :Openness => {:weighted_total => num, :count => count, :average => average },
  #   :Agreeableness => {:weighted_total => num, :count => count, :average => average }
